"""In order to manage the code better, modules in the Python Standard Library are split down into sub-modules that are contained within 
a package. A package is simply a module that contains sub-modules. A sub-module is specified with the usual dot notation.

Modules that are submodules are specified by the package name and then the submodule name separated by a dot. 
You can import the submodule like this."""

In this quiz, you'll be using different methods to import and use the random.randint() function from the random module.
Your task is to match the import statement with the way you would then call the function itself."""
